## About VDA Suite for Rainmeter
This skin suite is based on my learning Rainmeter and wanting something simple vs. others I found online. It's nothing fancy, but I love to put it in the upper right corner and leave it there while I work. I went for efficiency vs. fast updating. It has very little resource load and I use it daily now.

## Licenses
You may use this Rainmeter suite for personal use. If you distribute, charge for it, or alter it, you must contract Vince Arter, Jr. first (vince@vincearter.com) for permission and to ensure recognition.

Some components I'm using are licensed to others (Rainmeter itself, WebMediaPlayer plug-in). Check with their owners for information on usage rights.

## Notes
* You must have WebMediaPlayer for Rainmeter installed or the media player skin will not work. https://github.com/keifufu/WebNowPlaying-Rainmeter
* I've tried to make the colors and such as easily configurable as possible. You should be able to change the variables in the front matter to change it throughout the skins.
* If I can figure out how to do a better include approach I'd love to move all of the color and image config to a single file so you could impact change across the entire suite... but I haven't researched that yet.
